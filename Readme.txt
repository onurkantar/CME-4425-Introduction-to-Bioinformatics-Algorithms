Finding a Motif in DNA (SUBS)
Translating RNA into Protein (PROT)
Finding a Protein Motif (MPRT)
5. Paste the real question (that is asked by the system in your session), your answer to
asked question, and your code for each problem, e.g.:
Counting DNA sequences
Asked Question (by the system):
My Answer:
My Code:
You will need to do coding for each question, therefore:
- Read the example question and understand necessary input and output formats.
- Implement your solution with your preferred programming language.
- Request a real question from the ROSALIND system.
You will have maximum 5 minutes to reply each question. If your answer is wrong, you can
request a new question from the same topic. If you do not follow this specific question
order, you can not proceed to the next question.
