CME 4425 – Fall 2018 - Hw3
Multiple Sequence Alignment
Due: Dec 21, 2018 - 23:59

Input: k protein amino acid sequences (k= 3 … 5)
Goal: Perform multiple sequence alignment for given k protein amino acid
sequences.
Outputs:
1. Visualization of guide tree (output of Step2)
2. Multiple sequence alignment of k sequences (output of Step3)

Heuristic: Progressive alignment (similar to Clustal).
There are 3 main steps of a progressive alignment method.

Step 1 (50 points)
- Find pairwise sequence alignments for all possible pairs of sequences.
- Implement a global alignment to find each pairwise sequence alignment (i.e., fill
the dynamic programming table).
- Gap penalty will be asked to the user – input parameter.
- Match and mismatch scores for amino acids will be taken from the BLOSUM62
matrix.
- Compute similarity score for each pairwise alignment. A higher score represents
the more similar sequences.
Similarity Score (s i , s j ) = # of exact matches / aligned sequence length
- Construct similarity matrix (kxk) by using similarity scores.

Step 2 (20 points)
- Build a guide tree by using similarity matrix, which is calculated in the Step 1.
- Use neighbor joining method while creating tree branch i.e., group together the
most similar sequences at each iteration.

Step 3 (30 points)
- Merge alignments by starting the most similar ones to obtain the final multiple
alignment of k sequences.
- Use the guide tree to decide the merge order of each sequence.
- You will compute the edit table and use the backtrack matrix to align each new
sequence to the current multiple alignment.
- If there is a gap in an alignment, keep and reflect it to the next alignments, so apply
“once a gap, always a gap” strategy.

Notes:
- Group work (maximum three people) is allowed. If you prefer, you can do it by
yourself (might get extra points).
- Java, C, C++, C#, Python and Ruby can be used as programming languages.
- It is not allowed to use any kind of build-in library or function that performs one of
the major steps of the homework (e.g., alignment with dynamic programming, guide
tree construction etc.)
- Submit the source codes before the deadline to the Classroom page. I will check its
running with group members. So please come to my office on December 25 and
reserve an empty slot. If group members do not show their codes on that date, they
won’t get any grade from this homework.
